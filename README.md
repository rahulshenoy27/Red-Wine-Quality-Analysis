# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Red Wine Quality dataset to understand the factors affecting wine quality. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance, and predictive modeling using Google Colab.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
-Attributes include:
Physicochemical properties (e.g., acidity, pH, alcohol content)
Quality ratings (score from 0 to 10 based on sensory data)

## Analysis & Insights
The project includes:
- EDA: Data distribution, missing values, correlations
- Feature Engineering: Identifying key factors affecting wine quality
- Data Visualization: Using Seaborn & Matplotlib for trend analysis
- Predictive Modeling: Building classification & regression models
- Model Evaluation: Comparing different ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

## Tools & Technologies
Google Colab â€“ Cloud-based analysis & model training
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: Classification & regression models for wine quality prediction
